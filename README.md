# House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques
All the necessary information about the dataset can be found in [Kaggle]

# Getting Started

## Installing
This project requires Python 3.6 and the following Python libraries installed
 - [Numpy]
- [Scipy]
- [Scikit Learn]
- [matplotlib]
- [seaborn]

## Data Preprocessing

- Deal with outliers
- Deal with missing values
- Log - transformation of target variable
- Encoding categorical features

## Feature Engineering
- Creating new features based on house characteristics (e.g. year of buit, location and so on)

## Eploratory Data Analysis
- Visualize target variabel (Sale price)
- Visualize categorical variables with barplots
- Visualize categorical variables relationship with Sale Price with boxplots

## Models
Implement Cross-validation strategy 

Models used:

1. LassoCV, Recursive Feature Elimination (Feature Selection)
2. Random Forest Regressor
3. XGBoost
